## About

This is a collection of all kinds of fundation models in Deep Learning. It mainly targets reusable backbone models. The Top-1 priority of us is to make it readable and atomized. No fancy type injection, mixing configuration or other Python magics. The Simplicity and Explicityis the goal.

## Installation

The desired way of using this repository is copy-and-paste, but we also want to host it as a pretrained model hub.
To install `fundations`:

```bash
pip install torch-fundations
```
